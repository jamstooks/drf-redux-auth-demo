# drf-redux-auth-demo

[See the demo](https://drf-redux-auth-demo.herokuapp.com/)
(on a free Heroku instance... initial load might be slow)

An integrated demo site utilizes:

 - [django rest framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
 - [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 - the [drf-redux-auth](https://github.com/jamstooks/drf-redux-auth) package.

For more documentation, see the [drf-redux-auth](https://github.com/jamstooks/drf-redux-auth)
documentation.

Note: this also relies on an environment variable, `REACT_APP_AUTH_URL`
for the DRF URL for now.
